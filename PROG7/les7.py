# Nested loop pattern and 2-D lists

# Implement function pixels() that takes as input:
# • a two-dimensional list of nonnegative integer entries (representing the
# values of pixels of an image)
# and returns the number of entries that are positive (i.e., the number of pixels that are
# not dark). Your function should work on two-dimensional lists of any size.
